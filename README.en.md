## Overview

The ASS Subset Tool is an open-source, browser-based utility developed by MontageSubs (蒙太奇字幕组) for optimizing Advanced SubStation Alpha (.ass) and SubStation Alpha (.ssa) subtitle files.

The ASS/SSA format natively supports embedding font files directly into subtitle files, eliminating the need for end users to install fonts manually. However, complete font files can be several megabytes in size, causing significant file size bloat after UUEncoding. This tool applies font subsetting — retaining only the glyphs actually used in the subtitle — to minimize the embedded font size, while fully preserving all font name table entries to ensure correct recognition by media players.

All processing is performed locally in the user's browser. No file data is transmitted to any server.

## Features

**Drawing Command Subsetting**

Extracts `\p1`…`\p0` vector drawing data from subtitle dialogue lines and converts it into a compact embedded TTF font. Identical drawing shapes are stored only once and all duplicate references are replaced, substantially reducing file size and improving rendering compatibility on lower-performance devices such as Android TV set-top boxes.

**Font Subsetting and Embedding**

Scans the subtitle file for non-system font references, subsets the uploaded font files to include only the characters present in the subtitle, and embeds them using the UUEncoding standard. The full font Name Table is preserved to ensure correct playback across all major media players. Supports TTF, OTF, and TTC formats.

## Usage

This tool runs entirely in the browser. No installation is needed:

1. Open [https://subs.js.org/ass-subset/](https://subs.js.org/ass-subset/)
2. Upload your `.ass` or `.ssa` subtitle file
3. Review the analysis results, which show detected drawing commands and external font references
4. If font embedding is needed, upload the corresponding font files (TTF / OTF / TTC)
5. Click "开始转换" (Start Conversion) and download the optimized subtitle file

The output file will be named `original_filename_optimized.ass`.

> **Note:** Drawing command conversion may cause minor size or position shifts in typeset effects. Manual review of the output is recommended.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | License | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| [opentype.js](https://github.com/opentypejs/opentype.js) | 1.3.4 | MIT | Font parsing and construction |
| [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) | 3.x | MIT / Dual licensed | Batch output packaging |

Both dependencies are bundled as local copies in the `vendor/` directory of this repository. Their original copyright notices are preserved in accordance with their respective licenses.

opentype.js is used for font file parsing and binary construction. JSZip is used to package batch processing results into a .zip file for download after subtitle files have been processed through the subsetting queue.

## Localization

This tool currently provides a Chinese-language interface only. If you would like to use it in another language, or if you are interested in contributing a localization, please open a thread in [Issues](https://github.com/MontageSubs/ass-subset/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/MontageSubs/ass-subset/discussions). Multi-language support is on our future roadmap, and community input is very welcome.
